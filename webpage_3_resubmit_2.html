        How the Web Works
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          Essentially, the World Wide Web is a network that connects computers with servers.  The computers "talk" to servers by sending something called HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) requests.

        HTML
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          HTML or Hypertext Markup Language is the standard markup language used to create web pages.  It is written in the form of HTML elements consisting of tags enclosed in angle brackets.
        </p>

        Tags and Elements
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          An HTML tag is always contained within angled brackets.  Most tags have an opening tag and a closing tag.  An element refers to everything within a set of opening and closing tags.

        Computers are <i>smart</i>: people are <i>stupid!</i>
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          Unlike humans, computers follow instructions <i>exactly</i> as they are given.  So long as the syntax is correct computers will do precisely what they are told.  Humans, on the other hand, not so much.

        Inline vs Block Elements
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          Inline elements format everything in a single line.  Examples are: br (break), em (emphasis), and img (image).  Box elements format the contents within an invisible textbox.  Examples are: p (paragraph) and div (divide).

        Developer Tools (in the Browser)
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          The browser provides many useful tools for analyzing or creating a webpage.  For example, many of the attributes such as borders, color, font size, etc., can be changed interactively and the result can be viewed in real time.

        The "tree-like structure" of HTML
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
         HTML and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are both languages where HTML controls the placement of content and CSS controls the style (decoration) of content.  Java script is used to control the interactive components on the page.  These languages are organized using something called DOM or Document Object Model into a hierarchical structure resembling a tree.

      <div class="concept-title">
        Avoiding Repetition
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          Avoiding repetition is important for a variety of reasons.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Avoiding Errors:</b> CSS allows a particular style to be applied to several different elements by assigning a class.  This saves time, space, and helps reduce coding errors by eliminating the need for repitition.  Another property called inheritance governs rules which eliminate the need for certain styles to be declared repeatedly.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Consistency:</b> In this web page, I wanted every lesson to look the same. Instead of manually giving each one the same style, I was able to assign each lesson <span class="code">div</span> the same <span class="code">class</span> and then specify the style for that class in only one place! By avoiding repetion, it's now very easy for me to make changes to this style.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="concept" id="lesson-3-2">
      <div class="concept-title">
        CSS
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and they give programmers a way to control the style of related HTML elements. This is done by giving similar HTML elements the same <span class="code">class</span> name and then specifying the style that should apply to that class.

          <b>I was "That guy":</b> Yes, I was "That guy!"  You know the one!  He's the guy old as dirt that has never done Facebook, Twitter, or even sent a text message with his phone.  Don't text and drive?  What's texting anyways?  My phone can surf the net?  No way!  Won't it short out or something if it gets wet? Yeah, I'm that guy! Then his boss says update your skills or start practicing saying "Welcome to Costco, I love you!"

        <p>
            Then he signed up for Udacity's Introduction to Programming Nanodegree.  He learned how to create accounts to online "stuff" like github.com.  He learned how to <span class="code">link</span> files together and <span class="code">look</span> at HTML code using developer tools.  He used to be SO ashamed that 6 year old's knew more about smart phones, webpages, and the internet than he did, but thanks to Udacity now he knows how to make a snazzy looking golly gee-wiz webpage.  How freagin' cool is that?  There's still a lot of stuff the old giezer doesn't understand, but with Udacity's help he'll get there!  And that is why Udacity ROCKS!

      <div class="concept-title">
        Understanding Programming
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          To become proficient at programming one must first learn to think like a programmer.  Thinking like a programmer requires more than just investing in a pair or thick glasses and a pocket protector.  To think like a programmer one must master three things: one, procedural thinking; two, technological empathy; and three, abstract thinking.
        </p>  
        <p>
          Computer languages are similar to spoken language in that they employ a set of grammatical rules referred to as syntax.  Python, for example, uses the Backus Normal Form notation technique where commands are given in the form of expression, operator, expression.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some common "got-cha's" and other points to be mindful of in Python are: 1)Always introduce a variable before you use it.  2)Avoid programming bugs by following the convention of never capatalizing variables.  3)String variables must have the same number of quotes on both sides.  4)In addition to using single or double quotes you can also use tripple quotes to create a multi-line string.  5)The plus operator is used to concatenate two strings but can't combine a string and a number.  6)The multiply operator can be used to repeat a string.  7)A single equal operator means assignment and a double equal operator means equality.  8)When Python code crashes the message it gives you is called a "traceback."  The traceback tells you what line crashed and the file that was running.  9)To obtain a precise answer when dividing use a decimal place to invoke floatinig point division.

        Computational Problem Solving
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          Abstract thinking is the lion's share of solving any computational problem because you must first <i>understand</i> the problem.  Such problems are defined by possible inputs, possible outputs, and the relationship between them.  So a "solution" is a procedure that takes the inputs and produces the desired outputs.  Many beginners try to immediately translate the problem into code in their heads and get frustrated.  Verterans, on the other hand, employ tools such as psuedo code, simple mechanical algorithms, and think in terms of valid inputs and outputs before attempting to write any code.
        </p>
        <p>Pythonista's Guide to All Problems in the Galaxy can be summarized as follows:</p>
        <p>0. Don't Panic!</p>
        <p>1. What are the inputs?</p>
        <p>2. What are the outputs?</p>
        <p>3. Work through some examples by hand.</p>
        <p>4. Come up with a simple mechanical solution.</p>
        <p>5. Develop and test as you go.</p>

      <div class="concept-title">
        Understanding Functions
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>Functions are critical to eliminating repetition.  Python has many built in functions, but the true value is being able to define your own functions to perform a particular repetitive task.  When making functions watch for syntax errors, spelling errors, indentation errors, and be aware that calling a procedure without a return does nothing.</p>

        An Introduction to Lists: Mutation versus Aliasing and List Operators
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>There are two major differences between lists and strings: 1) Strings contain only characters whereas lists can contain anything.  2) Lists can support something called Mutation.</p>
        <p>Mutation sounds like the title of a low budget science fiction B-movie. However, in computer science, mutation means you can change the value of a list after you have created it.  For example, the append function mutates the old list by adding an element to the end.  Unlike in B-movies, this change requires no radiation or nuclear explosions.  Conversely, using the plus operator introduces a new list.</p>
        <p>Aliasing means there are two different ways to refer to the same object.</p>
        <p>The len function, returns the number of elements in the list.  The index operator, returns the first position where the value is found in the list otherwise it produces an error.  The in operator returns true if the value is contained in the list.</p>

        I See What You Did There!
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          Before we learned about lists, one of the work exercises asked us to print out the contents of a string.  We had just learned about while loops, but the instructions in the exercise did not mention we had to use a while loop to solve the problem.  Unable to immediately throw together code in my head I was tempted to just advance to the next video for the solution.  Instead, I thought about the problem, examined the possible inputs/outputs, and looked inside my <i>toolbox</i> to solve the problem with a while loop.
        </p>  
        <p>
          After solving the problem I reflected on the thought process and had to give kudos to Udacity for making me exercixe my abstract thinking skills.  I see what you did there, Udacity.  Very clever!

        O.O.P.
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          The acronym, O.O.P. sounded painfully familiar.  I struggled to recall the reference.  Was the familiar feeling related to a work group within my company called Office of The President? Suddenly the recollection hit me!  I was confusing O.O.P with a Pop song called O.P.P. from a Rap group named Naughty by Nature that climbed to #6 on the charts in 1991.  O.O.P is an acronym which stands for Object Oriented Programming so why would I confuse a programming language model with the title to a Pop song?   The answer is simple: Earworms!  More on Earworms in a moment, for now let us focus on how the introduction of O.O.P. revolutionized programming.
        </p>  
        <p>
          In the past a program was merely a set of sequential instructions written in a language computers could understand.  Code was clumsy, repetitive, and one error could completely halt execution.  O.O.P focuses on programming objects instead of instructions written in sequence and manipulates data instead of logic.  Imagine an <strong>object</strong> as an independent construct which contains data as well as functions.  The functions inside objects are called <strong>methods</strong>.

        Why O.O.P. is Valuable to Large Programming Projects
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          O.O.P. is valuable to large programming projects mainly because of the design benefits.  Large programs are simpler to code in O.O.P. than procedural programs.  Large O.O.P. programs require a more thorough planning phase which helps to eliminate bugs.  O.O.P. code can also be reused and recycled.  Encapsulation makes it possible to reuse code without having knowledge of how it was written.  Plus, encapsulation can be used to prevent alteration of certain segments of code.  Another important advantage of O.O.P. is that it is easier to maintain and update than other programming models.

      <div class="concept-title">
        Abstraction
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          Abstraction, as it pertains to computer science, is a difficult concept to define precisely.  Some say that abstraction is merely taking everyday objects and redefining them in programming terms.  A widely accepted definition of abstraction is the process of moving from a specific idea to a more general one.  When applied to Object Oriented Programming, abstraction refers to the use of classes, encapsulation, and inheritance to hide relevant data about an object which results in increased efficiency and simplicity of code.

        Modules
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          What if there was a way to define a function or set of executable statements outside your program?  Would that help keep things organized, make things easier to read, etc.?  Well Python has a way to do that by creating a segment of code called a <strong>Module</strong> and saving it with a dot py extension.  The ability to create Modules in Python is what makes it an ideal language for tackling both large and small programs.  Modules can be imported by invoking their filename; plus, modules can import other modules.

      <div class="concept-title">
        Classes and Instances
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          The concept of classes affords O.O.P the ability to reuse code making it easier to read and much more efficient.  You can think of a <strong>class</strong> as a blueprint which contains the technical specifications of a building you want to construct.  An object or <strong>instance</strong> of the class would be the actual building itself.  For example, in one of our exercises we were tasked with drawing a flower on the screen.  Rather than reinvent the code required to move the cursor on the screen we save time by importing the Python built-in graphics function called turtle.  Next, we created an instance of turtle which we named brad and brad inherited all of the functionality of the original class turtle.   
        </p>
        <p>Initially the relationship between classes, objects, and methods, appears mysterious and daunting.  I had many questions.  For example: What is the purpose of the variable self and why do you need to perform the init function?  Why is it necessary to initialize the same variables again when you call the Child constructor, etc.?</p>
        <p>So I followed the Udacity instructor closely during the lessons and carefully put my code into the interpreter.  When I executed the program for the movie webpage I kept getting an error saying that my function did not require any arguments.  What????  I was FURIOUS!!!!  I knew I had copied the code EXACTLY as the instructor had written it in the video!  I spent hours troubleshooting the tiny program completely clueless as to the incredibly simple but significant error that was causing my code to crash.</p>
        <p>I could have just asked for help, but my direction gene had been fully activated.  In case you are not familiar with this phraseology, the male direction gene is what stops men from asking for directions when they are lost.  I had a map and I was determined to figure this out on my own!  I am glad I did not give up because in real life, instructors will not always be there to bail me out.  Plus, the experience boosted my confidence in troubleshooting significantly.  Once I discovered that the init function must begin and end with TWO underscores the code worked beautifully.   Duh!!!!</p>

        Methods and class variables
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          Methods are procedures defined as part of a class.  A method can only manipulate data known to that particular instance or object.  Likewise, class variables are variables defined within a class and are only accessible to instances of that particular class.  Also, whenever a constant is declared in a class it is common practice to denote it using all caps.

        Inheritance and Method Overriding
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          <strong>Inheritance</strong> is a programming mechanism that allows a subclass to receive attributes and behavior methods from a parent class.  The easiest way to understand how inheritance works is by using an illustration where we create one class called Parent() and another class called Child(Parent).  In this example, the class called Child(Parent) publically inherits everything from the class called Parent(), including any methods created inside the class called Parent().  Method override occurs if a method of the same name is created within the Child(Parent) class.

          In Python, all classes come with some pre-existing class variable, for instance, __doc__ which prints out the documentation associated with a particular class.  In addition, Python also comes with an impressive collection of built in functions that do everything from manipulating files to drawing on the screen.  All of this documentation can be found in the Python Standard Library.  Here is the link: <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/">https://docs.python.org/2/library/</a>

          So what does the Pop song O.P.P., Earworms, and O.O.P. have in common?  In reality, nothing.  But, for me, this was a particularly challenging portion of the course and it required the persistence of an Earworm to get through it. In case you do not know, an Earworm is a song that gets stuck in your head and repeats endlessly becoming a kind of torture.  The song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xGuGSDsDrM">O.P.P.</a> is a virulent example second only to the infamous Country song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKZqGJONH68">Red Solo Cup</a>, by Toby Keith.  If you do not believe me then click on the hyperlinks to the videos - - but be warned, there is no cure for these Earworms.  Red solo cup, I lift you up!  Proceed to party!  Proceed to party!  Yes, after getting through this portion of the course it was time for a couple of cold ones.  Would you like one, too?
